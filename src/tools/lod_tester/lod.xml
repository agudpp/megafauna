<!-- LODEntity definition:
   - Each lod entity is composed by different level of deail meshes described in
   - <Level> where:
   -    meshName is the mesh to be used for that level
   -    distance is the distance that will activate that specific mesh.
   - The order in how are defined the Level are important, the first one is the 
   - "base" mesh and will be used for the closest one (when the camera is near
   - to the entity). In this example when the camera is between 0 and 50 units
   - of distance from the entity (bounding box) it will be used the mesh1. If
   - the camera is between 50 and 230 units of distance, mesh2 will be used.
   - And if the camera is far away than 230 units from the entity, mesh3 will be
   - used.
